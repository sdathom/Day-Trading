# Deciding Which Day to Trade
## Training Data
### This uses machine learning to train on the previous 2000 days. This creates a function where the buy/not buy decision is made.

## Testing data
### The function is then tested on the previous 200 days

## Visuals
### The testing data is then visualized and a confusion matrix is created. 

## Recommendation
### This creates a recommendation to buy or not buy the designated stock tomorrow at open. Since the target of the machine learning model is the in day return, the recommendation is to purchase at the open price then sell at the adjusted close price for a single day.
